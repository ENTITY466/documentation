v3.0.0 - Alpha 1
======

This marks the first alpha release of v3.0.0. This release has been years in the making.
It comes with significant changes to the backend and frontend to ensure a smoother experience.

The goals of v3 are to improve on things we learned from v2 and update the UI to a more friendly
look and feel. We are still working on improving aspects of the UI, so things may still change as
we go.

The backend has seen a clean up of how things work. The API has been standardized a bit more and
the documentation has been updated to account for this. The concept of the "proxy" no longer is
exposed publicly, but the API will still proxy requests as needed.

Templates have also been updated with the new concept of "conditions". This is a basic "if" statement
system that is designed to help consolidate our templates and drive better logic about if an operator
should run. Things that the conditions now support are checking if a variable is set or if it's a
certain value, if a file exist, or if something is in the PATH env. This means our templates now
can support both environments at the same time, with the conditions driving what operators may be used.

Commands now also support the condition concept. A server can have multiple different commands, and
one is chosen based on these conditions.

We have also moved to using the "any/any" repo. This means that we have a single repository that handles
the packages, so the workarounds for getting an "unsupported" or a newly released LTS version of an OS
should not be needed anymore.

Our Docker image also has been cleaned up. It has instead now been designed to only run the panel and
a node which creates Docker containers. It will no longer run servers inside of itself. This, while
useful to create a quick server, caused the image to be bloated and hard to manage. We also exposed a
new config entry so that servers using Docker can better expose a folder on the host that isn't explicitly
defined in the image. Previously, it was an explicit path, and changing it required changing several things.
Now, a single config entry allows hiding this.

We also have created a new "tester" designed to keep our templates more consistent and ensure they function
prior to being released. Generally speaking, the templates now have been at least validated to run and 
not crash immediately. This does mean we have removed several templates that either were not functional or
were believed to be dead software.
